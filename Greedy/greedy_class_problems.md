## 📌 Q1 — Minimum Scalar Product (Rearrangement Inequality)

🔗 **Problem Link:**  
https://open.kattis.com/problems/minimumscalar

📝 **Notes:**  
This is the **exact problem** discussed in class about rearranging two arrays to **minimize their dot product** using greedy sorting (one ascending, one descending).

## 📌 Q2 — CSES Task Scheduling / Projects

🔗 **Problem Link:**  
https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1630/

📝 **Notes:**  
⚠️ This problem is **not an exact match** to what was discussed in class,  
but it uses the **same greedy scheduling / sorting-by-ratio idea**.

## 📌 Q3 — Stone Game VI (Alice & Bob Greedy Game)

🔗 **Problem Link:**  
https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vi/description/

📝 **Notes:**  
This matches the **Alice & Bob card picking game** discussed in class.  
The greedy strategy is to **pick the card with maximum (Ai + Bi)**.

## 📌 Q4 — Codeforces 520B — Two Buttons (Operation Decode / Reverse Greedy)

🔗 **Problem Link:**  
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/520/B

📝 **Notes:**  
This is the **exact problem** discussed in class where you:
- Start from `B` and work backwards to `A`
- Use greedy + reverse thinking

## 📌 Q5 — Gas Station (Fuel / Cost Optimization)

🔗 **Problem Link:**  
https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/

📝 **Notes:**  
⚠️ This problem is **not an exact match** to what was discussed in class,  
but it is on **similar lines of greedy fuel / traversal optimization**.
